## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r The Data}
census <- read.csv("CENSUSNEW.csv")
summary(census)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(census$ELEMENTS, census$AGE, main="Elements vs Age", xlab = "Element", ylab = "Age", col = "orange")

plot(census$ELEMENTS, census$CAPITALGAINS, main="Elements vs Captial Gains", xlab = "Element", ylab = "Capital Gains", col = "darkgreen")

plot(census$ELEMENTS, census$YEARS, main="Elements vs Years", xlab = "Element", ylab = "Year", col = "orange")

plot(census$ELEMENTS, census$CAPITALLOSS, main="Elements vs Captial Losses", xlab = "Element", ylab = "Capital Losses", col = "darkgreen")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
